  # InteractiveShell
* An interactive user defined shell in C

# Complile

* Recompile : delete all .o file by make clean and then again do make. 

# Run
* Run using ./shell

# Features
## General
* Works almost like normal shell
* Coloured prompt 
* Keeps the directory where the shell is run, as home directory and shows the path of the current directory relative to that home directory
* Every command is run in new forked process
* Error Handling



## Background Processes

* Commands which have '&' appended, run in background
* When background process exits, shell display a message with its exit status



## Implemented Built-in-Commands

These commands are implemented as a part of shell
* cd  (Also "cd -" )

* pwd
* ls (ls -l, ls -al, ls -a, ls -la with directory name )
* setenv var [value] 
* unsetenv var 
* quit
* CTRL-Z
* CTRL-C
* pinfo
  * It returns process related information like pid, process status, memory, etc



### BONUS

1. Reminder: To prompt a message after a specified time.	
2. Echo: Discards quotes, prints environment variables.
3. clockt (interrupt,dirty) 
  * Non blocking user input method if User press 'q' then exit
4. Reminder: Sends you a given reminder "message" after a given amount of time.


### Specifications:

## Specification 1: Foreground and background processes

2. Handles Vim.

## Specification 2: Implement input-output redirection functionality

1. Output of running one (or more) commands can be redirected to a file. 

## Specification 3: Implement command redirection using pipes

1. Program can handle any number of pipes.   â€‹

## Specification 4: Implement i/o redirection + pipes redirection

- Use Case : Example => cat < in.txt | wc -l > lines.txt
